# Design, Development and Implementation of a Vibrating Table Prototype for the Validation of Structural Integrity of Cubesat Nanosatellites according to the International Regulations ’NASA GEVS GSF-STD-7000’

## Year: 2021-2022.

## Description. 

Final implementation, and combination of previous projects: 

    1.- One control system designed, available in: https://github.com/Lechuga-Geronimo/VibrationTestBench 

    2.- A mechanical vibration design, available in: https://github.com/Lechuga-Geronimo/MechanicalTestBench

Where the objective was to obtain an utility model of a vibration table as a product.
